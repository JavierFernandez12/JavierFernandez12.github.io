                <div class="section-title">1. Challenge Overview</div>
                <p>
                    Following the video guidelines, I developed a dynamic web application using <strong>PHP</strong> that simulates a dice game against a virtual opponent. The project consists of two pages:
                    1. <strong>Input Page (Form):</strong> The user selects the number of dice to roll, the number of faces per die, and sets the opponent's target score.
                    2. <strong>Results Page (Logic):</strong> The server processes the input, generates random rolls, displays the corresponding dice images, calculates the total points, and determines if the player won or lost against the set score.
                </p>

                <div class="section-title">2. Key Complex Concepts Learned</div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Server-Side Form Handling (<code>$_POST</code>):</strong> I learned how to capture user input securely from an HTML form using the PHP superglobal <code>$_POST</code> and validate that data before processing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dynamic Asset Rendering:</strong> Using loops (<code>for</code>) combined with random number generation (<code>rand()</code>) to dynamically construct the HTML <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tags, ensuring the correct die image matches the random number generated.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="section-title">3. Personal Reflection</div>
                <p>
                    It was very satisfying to see the logic come to life. At first, I had some trouble with the <strong>image paths</strong>, ensuring that if the random number was '3', the script loaded 'dice_3.png'. Once fixed, seeing the "You Win!" message appear based on my own code logic felt great.

                <div class="section-title">4. Proposed Improvements</div>
                <p>
                    Currently, the game restarts from zero. To improve it, I would use <strong>PHP Sessions</strong> to remember the user's settings (number of dice/faces) so they don't have to re-enter them every time they want to play again. I would also add CSS animations to make the dice "roll" on the screen.

                    <strong>Improvement for the statement:</strong> The video was clear, but providing the image assets (dice icons) beforehand would save time searching for them online.

                    I created a relational database named `BD_GAMES` containing three main tables: `GAMES`, `PLAYERS`, and `PARTIDAS` (Matches). The goal was to build a PHP web application with a dashboard (`index.php`) providing direct links to manage these tables and displaying a control summary (e.g., total number of games, players, matches, and advanced statistics like players participating in 2, 3, or more than 3 matches). Each table management section required dedicated pages to view the data in HTML tables, insert new records, modify specific fields by ID, and delete records. The final code was submitted via Git.

                    Building the summary control board with advanced SQL queries was challenging. Recording the final demonstration video highlighting all functionalities in under 1:01 minutes forced me to ensure the UI flow was smooth and error-free.

                    I would upgrade the application by using PDO (PHP Data Objects) and prepared statements for all database interactions to ensure robust protection against SQL injection attacks during the insert and modify processes.

                <h3>Challenge #3: Advanced Redis Caching with PHP</h3>
                <span class="badge">PHP / Redis / Performance</span>
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
                
                <div class="section-title">1. Challenge Overview</div>
                <p>
                    For the "App Aceitunas" project, I built a PHP web app to manage Harvesters (`Vareadores`) and Olive Trees (`Olivos`) using a Many-to-Many relational structure, allowing users to view, add, modify, and delete records. The key technical challenge was implementing Redis as an intermediate caching layer to optimize MySQL queries. I configured specific expiration times (TTL) for the cache: 10 seconds for numeric keys and 60 seconds for text-based keys. The system architecture follows a strict flow: check Redis first; if the key is missing, fetch the data from MySQL, return it, and store it in Redis for future requests.
                </p>

                <div class="section-title">2. Key Complex Concepts Learned</div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Server Administration & Compilation:</strong> I learned how to install the `php-redis` extension from source via Git, which involved using `phpize` and fixing critical C11 atomic header incompatibilities (`zend_atomic.h`) within the XAMPP environment using stream editors (`sed`).</li>
                    <li><strong>Redis Data Structures in PHP:</strong> I managed data beyond simple strings by utilizing Redis Hashes (`hSet`, `hGet`, `hGetAll`) to store user objects and Lists (`lPush`, `lRange`, `rPop`) to manage task queues directly through the PHP Redis object.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="section-title">3. Personal Reflection</div>
                <p>
                    The initial setup was demanding, especially troubleshooting the header compilation errors in Linux. However, successfully patching the system and seeing the `phpinfo()` screen confirm the Redis module was active felt incredibly rewarding. Understanding the logic of the caching flow diagram changed how I view web performance optimization.
                </p>

                <div class="section-title">4. Proposed Improvements</div>
                <p>
                    Instead of relying solely on TTL for cache expiration, I would implement active cache invalidation. This means the system would proactively delete or update the Redis cache whenever a Harvester or Olive Tree record is modified or deleted in the MySQL database.
