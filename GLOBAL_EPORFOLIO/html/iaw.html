                <div class="section-title">1. Challenge Overview</div>
                <p>
                    Following the video guidelines, I developed a dynamic web application using <strong>PHP</strong> that simulates a dice game against a virtual opponent. The project consists of two pages:
                    1. <strong>Input Page (Form):</strong> The user selects the number of dice to roll, the number of faces per die, and sets the opponent's target score.
                    2. <strong>Results Page (Logic):</strong> The server processes the input, generates random rolls, displays the corresponding dice images, calculates the total points, and determines if the player won or lost against the set score.
                </p>

                <div class="section-title">2. Key Complex Concepts Learned</div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Server-Side Form Handling (<code>$_POST</code>):</strong> I learned how to capture user input securely from an HTML form using the PHP superglobal <code>$_POST</code> and validate that data before processing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dynamic Asset Rendering:</strong> Using loops (<code>for</code>) combined with random number generation (<code>rand()</code>) to dynamically construct the HTML <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tags, ensuring the correct die image matches the random number generated.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="section-title">3. Personal Reflection</div>
                <p>
                    It was very satisfying to see the logic come to life. At first, I had some trouble with the <strong>image paths</strong>, ensuring that if the random number was '3', the script loaded 'dice_3.png'. Once fixed, seeing the "You Win!" message appear based on my own code logic felt great.
                </p>

                <div class="section-title">4. Proposed Improvements</div>
                <p>
                    Currently, the game restarts from zero. To improve it, I would use <strong>PHP Sessions</strong> to remember the user's settings (number of dice/faces) so they don't have to re-enter them every time they want to play again. I would also add CSS animations to make the dice "roll" on the screen.
                </p>

                <div class="section-title">5. Technical Glossary</div>
                <ul class="tech-list">
                    <li><strong>PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor):</strong> A server-side scripting language designed for web development.</li>
                    <li><strong>$_POST:</strong> A PHP super global variable used to collect form data sent with the HTTP POST method.</li>
                    <li><strong>Control Structures:</strong> Blocks of code (if/else, loops) that determine the flow of execution based on conditions (e.g., if total > opponent).</li>
                    <li><strong>Rand():</strong> A built-in PHP function used to generate a random integer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Backend Logic:</strong> The part of the application that runs on the server (calculations, database interactions) rather than the browser.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="rating-box">
                    <strong>Rating:</strong> 8.5/10 <br>
                    <strong>Reason:</strong> A classic but effective exercise to understand the request-response cycle in web apps.
                    <strong>Improvement for the statement:</strong> The video was clear, but providing the image assets (dice icons) beforehand would save time searching for them online.
