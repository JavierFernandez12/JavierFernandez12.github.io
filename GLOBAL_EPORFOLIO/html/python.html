                <div class="section-title">1. Challenge Overview</div>
                <p>
                    I developed a Python program to calculate the entrance fee for an amusement park based on 7 input parameters (Age, Residence, Height, etc.) and <strong>12 prioritized rules</strong>. The program had to evaluate complex conditions (e.g., "School group on Monday OR Friday") to apply discounts or surcharges to the base price (€45). The final output had to display the price using <strong>ASCII Art</strong> digits.

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Boolean Logic & Priority:</strong> I mastered the use of `if-elif-else` chains combined with `and/or` operators. The key challenge was respecting the <strong>priority table</strong>: rule #1 (Free for seniors > 65) had to be checked before rule #12 (Base Tariff), requiring a strictly ordered logic flow.</li>
                    <li><strong>ASCII Art Output:</strong> Instead of a simple print, I learned to map integer results to multi-line string representations (ASCII numbers) to create a visual ticket.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="section-title">3. Personal Reflection</div>
                <p>
                    I felt <strong>challenged</strong> by the logic. Debugging why a "Club Member from Madrid" wasn't getting the correct discount because a previous condition triggered first was tricky. Once the logic flowed correctly through all 12 rules, I felt <strong>accomplished</strong>.

                <p>
                    The code has many nested `if` statements. I would improve it by implementing a <strong>Rule Engine pattern</strong>: creating a list of Rule objects with 'condition' and 'action' attributes, and iterating through them. This would make adding a 13th rule much easier.

                    <li><strong>Boolean Operator:</strong> Symbols (AND, OR, NOT) used to connect and define the relationship between values in a conditional statement.</li>

                    <li><strong>Hardcoding:</strong> Embedding data directly into the source code (e.g., the €45 base price) instead of using variables or config files.</li>
                    <li><strong>Input Validation:</strong> The process of ensuring that user input is clean, correct, and useful (e.g., ensuring Age is an integer).</li>

                    <strong>Rating:</strong> 9.5/10 <br>
                    <strong>Reason:</strong> Excellent logic exercise. It forces you to think like a computer processing ordered rules.
                    <strong>Improvement for the statement:</strong> The priority rules were clear, but the ASCII requirement was a sudden jump in difficulty compared to the logic part.

                <h3>Challenge #2: Creative Graphics with Turtle</h3>
                <span class="badge">Python / Turtle / Algorithms</span>

                <div class="section-title">1. Challenge Overview</div>
                <p>
                    This assignment explored the <strong>Turtle</strong> library to understand coordinate systems and algorithmic drawing. The work consisted of three parts:
                    1. <strong>The Star:</strong> Drawing the specific "La Salle" star logo using precise angles.
                    2. <strong>The Name:</strong> Writing my name ("Root") on the canvas without using the <code>write()</code> function, meaning I had to program the path for every letter manually.
                    3. <strong>Creative Drawing:</strong> A complex freestyle design executing over 30 functions, where I used loops to create a spiral geometric pattern.
                </p>

                <div class="section-title">2. Key Complex Concepts Learned</div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Algorithmic Thinking:</strong> I learned to break down complex shapes (like a letter 'R') into small, reusable steps (forward, turn, pen up, pen down). It changed how I view vector graphics.</li>
                    <li><strong>Loops for Geometry:</strong> Understanding how `for` loops combined with mathematical increments (e.g., `forward(i)` inside a loop) can create organic, spiral shapes that grow naturally.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="section-title">3. Personal Reflection</div>
                <p>
                    Writing my name letter by letter was <strong>tedious but rewarding</strong>. Calculating the exact coordinates so the letters wouldn't overlap was a puzzle. However, seeing the final creative spiral animate on the screen was mesmerizing and made me feel <strong>artistic</strong> using code.

                <div class="section-title">4. Proposed Improvements</div>
                <p>
                    My code is currently linear. To improve it, I would define a <strong>function for each letter</strong> (e.g., `draw_R()`, `draw_O()`) to make the code modular and reusable for writing other words.
                </p>

                    <li><strong>Turtle:</strong> A pre-installed Python library that enables users to create pictures and shapes by providing a virtual canvas.</li>

                    <li><strong>Coordinates (x,y):</strong> A set of values that show an exact position on the canvas grid.</li>
                    <li><strong>Refactoring:</strong> The process of restructuring existing computer code without changing its external behavior (e.g., creating functions).</li>

                    <strong>Reason:</strong> A fun way to learn syntax, though it has limited real-world application for sysadmins compared to scripting.
