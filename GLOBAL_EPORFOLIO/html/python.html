            <div class="card-body">
                
                <div class="section-title">1. Challenge Overview</div>
                <p>
                    I developed a Python program to calculate the entrance fee for an amusement park based on 7 input parameters (Age, Residence, Height, etc.) and <strong>12 prioritized rules</strong>. The program had to evaluate complex conditions (e.g., "School group on Monday OR Friday") to apply discounts or surcharges to the base price (€45). The final output had to display the price using <strong>ASCII Art</strong> digits.
                </p>

                <div class="section-title">2. Key Complex Concepts Learned</div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Boolean Logic & Priority:</strong> I mastered the use of `if-elif-else` chains combined with `and/or` operators. The key challenge was respecting the <strong>priority table</strong>: rule #1 (Free for seniors > 65) had to be checked before rule #12 (Base Tariff), requiring a strictly ordered logic flow.</li>
                    <li><strong>ASCII Art Output:</strong> Instead of a simple print, I learned to map integer results to multi-line string representations (ASCII numbers) to create a visual ticket.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="section-title">3. Personal Reflection</div>
                <p>
                    I felt <strong>challenged</strong> by the logic. Debugging why a "Club Member from Madrid" wasn't getting the correct discount because a previous condition triggered first was tricky. Once the logic flowed correctly through all 12 rules, I felt <strong>accomplished</strong>.

                <div class="section-title">4. Proposed Improvements</div>
                <p>
                    The code has many nested `if` statements. I would improve it by implementing a <strong>Rule Engine pattern</strong>: creating a list of Rule objects with 'condition' and 'action' attributes, and iterating through them. This would make adding a 13th rule much easier.

                    <strong>Reason:</strong> Excellent logic exercise. It forces you to think like a computer processing ordered rules.
                    <strong>Improvement for the statement:</strong> The priority rules were clear, but the ASCII requirement was a sudden jump in difficulty compared to the logic part.

                <div class="section-title">1. Challenge Overview</div>
                <p>
                    This assignment explored the <strong>Turtle</strong> library to understand coordinate systems and algorithmic drawing. The work consisted of three parts:
                    1. <strong>The Star:</strong> Drawing the specific "La Salle" star logo using precise angles.
                    2. <strong>The Name:</strong> Writing my name ("Root") on the canvas without using the <code>write()</code> function, meaning I had to program the path for every letter manually.
                    3. <strong>Creative Drawing:</strong> A complex freestyle design executing over 30 functions, where I used loops to create a spiral geometric pattern.
                </p>

                <div class="section-title">2. Key Complex Concepts Learned</div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Algorithmic Thinking:</strong> I learned to break down complex shapes (like a letter 'R') into small, reusable steps (forward, turn, pen up, pen down). It changed how I view vector graphics.</li>
                    <li><strong>Loops for Geometry:</strong> Understanding how `for` loops combined with mathematical increments (e.g., `forward(i)` inside a loop) can create organic, spiral shapes that grow naturally.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="section-title">3. Personal Reflection</div>
                <p>
                    Writing my name letter by letter was <strong>tedious but rewarding</strong>. Calculating the exact coordinates so the letters wouldn't overlap was a puzzle. However, seeing the final creative spiral animate on the screen was mesmerizing and made me feel <strong>artistic</strong> using code.

                <div class="section-title">4. Proposed Improvements</div>
                <p>
                    My code is currently linear. To improve it, I would define a <strong>function for each letter</strong> (e.g., `draw_R()`, `draw_O()`) to make the code modular and reusable for writing other words.

                <h3>Challenge #3: Navarredonda Visual App</h3>
                <span class="badge">Python / Tkinter / GUI</span>

                <p>
                    [cite_start]I transformed the previous Navarredonda console simulator into a visual application using the Python Tkinter library[cite: 380]. [cite_start]The application features a main screen with an image, and a top menu bar with "Calcular", "Ver Resultado", and "Salir" options[cite: 381, 383]. [cite_start]Under the "Calcular" menu, I created submenus ("Persona", "Grupo", "Tipo de día") that open separate windows to capture user data using inputs, checkboxes, and radio buttons[cite: 384, 386, 387, 389, 393, 408, 420]. [cite_start]Finally, the "Ver Resultado" window calculates the final price based on the input or uses default fallback values (e.g., Age 21, Height 1.55cm) if information is missing[cite: 430, 432].
                </p>

                <div class="section-title">2. Key Complex Concepts Learned</div>
                <ul>
                    [cite_start]<li><strong>Event-Driven Programming:</strong> Learning how to bind functions to GUI events, such as opening a new window or saving data when a button like "Guardar" or "Usar selección" is clicked[cite: 394, 404, 408, 417, 420, 427].</li>
                    <li><strong>State Management across Windows:</strong> Handling data flow between different Tkinter <code>Toplevel</code> windows. [cite_start]The challenge was ensuring that the data entered in the "Persona" window persisted and could be accessed by the main calculation function[cite: 394].</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="section-title">3. Personal Reflection</div>
                <p>
                    Transitioning from a text-based console to a Graphical User Interface was a major leap. [cite_start]Managing the layout and ensuring checkboxes appeared "checked 80% of the times" [cite: 393] required creative logic within the GUI framework. [cite_start]It felt satisfying to see the final price displayed in a large, bold blue font on the result screen[cite: 434, 435, 436].
                </p>

                <div class="section-title">4. Proposed Improvements</div>
                <p>
                    I would improve the user experience by adding input validation directly within the GUI (e.g., preventing the user from entering text in the "Edad" field) and using popup message boxes (<code>messagebox.showerror</code>) to alert them immediately instead of relying on fallback values later.

                    [cite_start]I developed a web application using Python and the Flask framework to simulate a car dashboard[cite: 440, 457]. [cite_start]The app is divided into a visual top section displaying the car's state (Engine On/Off, Speed, Turn Signals) and a bottom control panel with functional buttons[cite: 461, 462, 463, 464, 465, 466, 470, 471]. [cite_start]The system enforces strict operational logic: actions like accelerating, turning, or using the horn (which plays a real audio file) are only available after the car is explicitly started[cite: 488, 492, 493, 494, 495, 496, 497, 498, 499, 520, 521, 522].

                    [cite_start]<li><strong>State Management & Logic Constraints:</strong> Implementing complex rules such as adjusting speed by a user-defined increment without going below 0 km/h [cite: 476, 502, 503, 504, 505, 506, 507][cite_start], managing mutually exclusive turn signals that stop upon acceleration [cite: 469, 508, 510, 511, 515, 516, 517, 519][cite_start], and resetting all states to zero when the car is turned off[cite: 524, 525, 526, 527, 528].</li>

                    Setting up the Flask environment via the terminal felt very professional. [cite_start]The hardest part was maintaining the correct state on the server and reflecting it visually in real-time on the client side, especially making the turn signal icons blink[cite: 468, 513, 518, 532].

                    Currently, the page likely refreshes on every button press.

                    I enrolled in the "#Introducció a la programació en Python#" course on the jutge.org platform to rigorous algorithmic training. The task involved solving all the programming problems within the "Comencem!" (Let's begin!) and "Bucles" (Loops) sections, ensuring every submission achieved an "OK" result from the automated judge.

                    Working with an automated judge is humbling; a single space or missing character results in a "Presentation Error" or "Wrong Answer". Achieving the green "OK" screens for all the loop exercises felt like earning badges of honor for code precision.
