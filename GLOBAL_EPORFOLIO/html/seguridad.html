                <span class="badge">Hydra / Pydictor / DVWA</span>

                <p>
                    This comprehensive challenge focused on simulating brute-force attacks using Kali Purple. The work was divided into three stages:
                    (1) <strong>Preparation:</strong> Creating custom wordlists using <strong>Pydictor</strong> and merging them with <strong>Dymerge</strong>.
                    (2) <strong>Infrastructure Attack:</strong> Setting up an SSH server and using <strong>Hydra</strong> to crack a user's password.
                    (3) <strong>Web Attack:</strong> Deploying <strong>DVWA</strong> and using Hydra to brute-force a login web form via HTTP POST requests.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Protocol-Specific Brute Force:</strong> I learned the significant difference between attacking a standard network protocol like SSH versus a stateless web protocol like HTTP, where you must identify failure strings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dictionary Engineering:</strong> Understanding that effective hacking isn't just about the tool, but about the quality of the "ammunition" (wordlists).</li>

                    The experience was a roller coaster. The SSH part was <strong>exciting</strong>—seeing the password crack successfully gave me a rush. However, the HTTP part caused some <strong>frustration</strong> because getting the correct syntax for Hydra's <code>http-post-form</code> was tricky and required trial and error.

                    To improve the workflow, I would write a <strong>Bash script</strong> to automate the dictionary generation. For the web attack, I would use <strong>Burp Suite</strong> to capture the request headers instead of browser tools for better accuracy.

                <h3>Challenge #2: Advanced Permissions & Forensics</h3>

                    This practice focused on hardening the filesystem and mastering command-line auditing.
                    <strong>Phase 1:</strong> I managed a multi-user environment (`monon1`, `tronko2`, `birmingan3`) implementing advanced permissions like <strong>SGID</strong> for collaborative folders, <strong>Sticky Bit</strong> for secure temporary directories, and <strong>ACLs</strong> for granular access.
                    <strong>Phase 2:</strong> I performed forensic-style searches using <code>grep</code>, <code>find</code>, and <code>locate</code> to identify critical errors in logs and hidden configuration files within a complex directory structure.
                </p>

                <div class="section-title">2. Key Complex Concepts Learned</div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Special Permission Bits (SGID & Sticky):</strong> Understanding how SGID forces new files to inherit the parent directory's group (essential for team collaboration) and how Sticky Bit prevents users from deleting each other's files in shared folders like <code>/tmp</code>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Access Control Lists (ACLs):</strong> I learned that standard `rwx` permissions are limited. ACLs allow granting specific permissions to a single user without changing the group ownership.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="section-title">3. Personal Reflection</div>
                <p>
                    Calculating the <strong>umask</strong> (subtracting from 777) was confusing at first. However, verifying that user `birmingan3` could not delete `monon1`'s file due to the Sticky Bit gave me a strong sense of <strong>control and security</strong>. The search exercises with regex made me feel very efficient.

                <p>
                    I would create a <strong>setup script</strong> that automatically creates the users and directory structure to reset the environment quickly for testing. Also, I would practice using <code>chattr</code> (immutable bit) for even higher security on critical logs.

                    As part of "Team 1", we researched and delivered a 10-minute oral presentation covering <strong>Viruses, Macro Malware, Rootkits, and Drive-by downloads</strong>.
                    The strict requirements included speaking without notes, covering attack techniques, consequences, and analyzing a real-world case study.
                    Additionally, we practiced version control by committing our progress after every class (<code>[clase]</code>) and home session (<code>[casa]</code>).

                    Speaking in public without notes was <strong>nerve-wracking</strong> at first, but preparing the script thoroughly gave me confidence. Investigating real cases of "Drive-by downloads" made me feel much more <strong>cautious</strong> about web browsing.

                    This lab focused on exploiting and patching two of the most critical web vulnerabilities: <strong>SQL Injection (SQLi)</strong> and <strong>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</strong>.
                    I developed vulnerable web apps using <strong>Python Flask</strong> and <strong>PHP</strong>.
                    First, I bypassed a login screen using SQL payloads like <code>' OR 1=1 --</code>. Then, I injected JavaScript alerts using Reflected and Persistent XSS. Finally, I secured the code using <strong>Prepared Statements</strong> and <strong>Input Sanitization</strong> (<code>htmlspecialchars</code>).
                </p>

                <div class="section-title">2. Key Complex Concepts Learned</div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>SQL Injection (String Concatenation vs. Prepared Statements):</strong> I understood that concatenating user input directly into SQL queries allows attackers to manipulate the logic of the database. The fix is treating input as parameters, not executable code.</li>
                    <li><strong>XSS Types (Reflected vs. Persistent):</strong> Reflected XSS happens immediately via URL parameters (e.g., search bars), while Persistent XSS stores the malicious script in the database, executing it every time a victim loads the page (e.g., comments section).</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    It was shockingly <strong>easy</strong> to bypass the login with a simple string. It made me realize how fragile legacy code can be. Fixing the vulnerabilities gave me a sense of <strong>responsibility</strong>; writing secure code is not optional, it's mandatory.

                    I manually tested the payloads. To improve, I would use automated tools like <strong>SQLMap</strong> to see how deep the exploitation can go, and maybe implement a <strong>WAF (Web Application Firewall)</strong> (like ModSecurity) to see how it filters these attacks.

                    Working in a team of three, we researched and documented core network security concepts: Firewalls, DMZ, Proxy, and VPN. We then designed and implemented a virtualized network architecture across two challenges. The final environment included two pfSense firewalls (External and Internal), an OpenVPN server located in the DMZ, a dedicated Squid Proxy server on the LAN, and an internal client machine. We concluded the project with an oral presentation.

                    <li><strong>Advanced Firewall Routing & NAT:</strong> I configured the External pfSense to handle NAT for internet access and created strict rules to block direct traffic from the DMZ to the LAN, only allowing specific exceptions like the VPN accessing the Proxy on port 3128.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proxy Filtering & ACLs:</strong> I learned how to configure Squid to restrict network access. I implemented Access Control Lists (ACLs) to block specific domains (like Facebook and YouTube) using a blacklist file and enforced time-based restrictions to only allow browsing during working hours.</li>

                    Connecting the different subnets (WAN, DMZ, LAN) correctly in VirtualBox was a great puzzle. Testing the connectivity was incredibly rewarding; watching the `/var/log/squid/access.log` actively register `TCP_DENIED` when I tried to access a blocked site confirmed that my security policies were actually working.

The scope covered Phishing Toolkits (analyzing headers, IP reputation, links, and attachments) and Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) tools for investigating passwords, social engineering vectors, emails, social networks, and utilizing specialized search engines.
