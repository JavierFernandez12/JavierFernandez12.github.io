                <p>
                    In this task, I worked with dictionary generation tools to prepare for brute-force attacks. I used Pydictor to create two specific wordlists: one with numeric patterns and another with uppercase letters. Then, I used Dymerge to fuse these two lists into a single master dictionary named diccionarion.

                <div class="section-title">2. Key Complex Concepts Learned</div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dictionary Merging:</strong> I learned how to combine multiple small, specific wordlists into a larger, more effective payload using tools like Dymerge, rather than relying on static lists.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pattern-based Generation:</strong> I understood how to use Pydictor to generate passwords based on specific rules (length, character type) instead of random guessing.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="section-title">3. Personal Reflection</div>
                <p>
                    At first, I felt a bit confused by the command-line flags of Pydictor. However, seeing Dymerge successfully combine the files gave me a sense of satisfaction. It felt like preparing the "ammunition" before the battle.

                <div class="section-title">4. Proposed Improvements</div>
                <p>
                    The process was manual. To improve it, I would write a small Bash script that automatically installs the tools if they are missing and generates the dictionary with a single command to save time.

                    <strong>6. Assignment Rating:</strong> 8/10 <br>
                    <strong>Feedback:</strong> Good introduction to the tools, but I would have liked to try generating a dictionary based on a specific person's social media data (profiling).
